In conclusion, our research presents a groundbreaking approach to home automation, eliminating the need for wearables by harnessing the power of two cameras to pinpoint a person's exact position in 3D space. By tracking the individual's head orientation in real-time, we've devised a sophisticated line of sight equation that accurately determines which device within the room the person is focusing on. This innovation not only streamlines the user experience but also opens up new possibilities for intuitive interaction with smart devices in the home environment.

Looking ahead, the implications of our findings extend far beyond the realm of home automation. The precise tracking capabilities we've developed have potential applications in various fields, including healthcare, where hands-free control of devices could aid patients with limited mobility, and security systems, where seamless tracking of individuals' movements enhances monitoring capabilities. As technology continues to evolve, our research serves as a testament to the endless possibilities of integrating cutting-edge advancements to simplify and enrich daily life.
