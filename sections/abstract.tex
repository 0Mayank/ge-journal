Advances in computer vision and machine learning have paved the way for innovative home automation solutions that can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with physical disabilities. In this research, we present the development of a gesture-based home automation system that allows users to control appliances without the need for any wearable devices. This hands-free approach empowers users to easily interact with their environment, thereby enhancing their independence and quality of life. The research presented in this paper outlines the technical implementation details, evaluates the system's performance, and discusses the potential impact of this gesture-based home automation solution on the lives of individuals with physical disabilities.
